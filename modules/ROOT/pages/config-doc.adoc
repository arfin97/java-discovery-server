. You are probably seeing a lot of errors popping up in your console. Thatâ€™s because you added Eureka Discovery Client Dependency in your class path. This dependency will try to register itself in a discovery server. As there is no server yet. It is throwing exceptions.

. Create a discovery Server: 
image::ROOT:spring-initilizer-discovery-server.png[]

. Give port 8761 and name discovery-server in application.properties

. Add @EnableEurekaServer annotation in the main class to make it a discovery server.
. Add @EnableEurekaClient annotation in the client classes to make them Eureka client.
. You will see all the clients in the Eureka Dashboard.
. Add load balanced annotation into your rest template bean of movie-service.
. Change the names of HardCoded URLS to application name to make it fully server dependent.
. Hit the movie-service again and see if it is getting the data.
